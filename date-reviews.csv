Pooja Gupta,"Went to grab a bite at the food-court of the local mall. She loved talking about music and was trying to learn how to sing. Was very passionate about helping other people and wanted to pursue a carrer in social work. Was a very positive, genuine and caring person. Had a great time."
Max Wilson,"Grabbed some food at Barrio. He talked a lot about cooking and contantly wanting to try new cuizines. Was very focused on school, and doing research at the lab where he worked. Seemed like a passionate and interesting guy."
Jacob Neczypor,We went to get drinks and dinner at Cazuelas. He was really psyched about the OSU game on Sunday and was very enthusiastic about the NBA as well. He was a business major and seemed outgoing and confident. Had a fun time
Dan Peters,Got lunch at Hot Chicken Takeover. He kept bragging about how much spicy food he could eat and laughed when I said I could not handle it. Did not ask me much about myself and kept talking about how smart and athletic he was. He was arrogant and cocky; Would not go out with him again.
Luke Meyer,Met up with him for drinks and dinner. He was funny and cute. I was laughing throughout the date and had a great time. He also seemed very passionate about his career goals and his family. Would definitely like to have another date with him.
Turner Kendal,"Went to Olive Tree for dinner. Our conversation went pretty well. He likes to talk about multi cultures, his hometown, and current world’s events. He seems to be a good conversationalist and understanding. Though he can’t stand the idea of being a vegan or dating a vegan. "
Simon Robbins,"We went to Melt for grilled cheese and it was an interesting place for a date in halloween time. We talk about music particularly rock, concerts, and traveling. He has never traveled out of the country however he is pretty knowledgeable with the world's geography and knows about the places. We exchanged which places we would wanna go in the future."
Matt Johson,We went to a drake performance theatre to watch a play. He seems to like musicals and hamilton. The play was fun and interesting. He also likes to talk about politics and religions from his perspective since he grew up with them. He is respectful although he has his strong beliefs. So it seems it would be a dealbreaker if the girl isn’t standing the same beliefs like him.
Mark Win,"The date was in Cafe Istanbul. Mark is a third culture kid who grew up in Norway and Hong Kong. He is a well-traveled, kind, and has a unique sense of humor. He works in a tech consulting firm and is pretty knowledgeable in tech and business sites. Our conversation was all over the place from talking about growing up as a third culture kid, speaking multiple languages and current career."
Milly Carrot,We met at a local coffee shop. She loves caffeine as much as she loves people. She is a bubbly person who is sweet and kind. She seems to be put together with her career and her personal life. We had a great time chatting on different topics and we both like to be financially independent so it clicked pretty well. She is also very frank and funny. We both like to hike and climb so we plan to go as a second date for hiking.
Bryan Kook,We walked to the park and he talked non stop the whole time. He has a dark humor though he stared at me when I didn’t laugh at his jokes. He is into art and history. He wore suits as his go-to fashion. He likes to show off how much he knows about history and geography. He is 6’6” so definitely tall and he is really proud of that.
Lizzie Shell,"We grabbed coffee on campus. She seems to be almost busy most of the time with her work, school, and social. She is a pre-med but studying engineering for her undergrad. She is very ambitious and she is very kind. She and I have a similar sense of humor. She laughed at my jokes all the time and so did I. It seems she isn’t playing around."
Oliver Woods,"Went to Sacred Palm which is underground of mikey's late night slice. I would say the location surprised me because I always went to late night slice and never knew that bar existed. He knows the places and he seems to be a pretty chill person who likes to vibe. He is funny, intelligent and cute. He doesn’t sound like he knows it all but he is pretty good at things and open-minded. He likes 80s music and is a big fan of star wars."
Andrew Simon,He did not give me a good impression in the beginning because he tried to fake brittish accent to impress me. I was pretty done and almost call it a night but he turned out he was being just funny and we both have a common interest in learning languages and weirdly like to talk about investing. We hit it off really quickly there and we found out we went to the same public university. We will be friends in the future for sure. 
Mike Stevens,This man was super basic but it was a first date so it's fine. We went around high street and snacked at different places by campus. It seems that he really likes to eat and try different things so we'll see there's something cool about him on later dates.
Carrie Zicheng,"Went on a couple dates with her and they were great. We saw different comedy movies so I think she really likes humor (even dark humor!). However, she is a bit demanding so I hope that her judgemental attitude won't affect later dates."
Tiger Patel,Got coffee at Kafe Kerouac. He got a White Russian cocktail there so I guess he likes to drink. He said that he likes to go the gym so he seems to be a tough guy. He can probably protect me if I ever feel scared but also make me comfortable. 
Stevie Cooper,Didn't have a great time with him. He's rich and it's show in his personality. He's snobby and disrecpetful but he tried to hide. At least I got a good meal but I don't plan on seeing him again. 
Annie Hoover,"Got bubble tea with her. It was tough to reach out to her via text but that's because she doesn't go on her phone too often. During our date, she rarely looked at her and kept her focus on me. She likes to live in the moment."
Ruri Tamako,Was a little bossy and seeking attention but she was funny. Funny but mean. She likes to go on Reddit because she was on it during the date. I guess she really likes memes so you'd always be entertained by her humor. 
Jin Morie,Super energetic and lively. He seemed to be in a very good mood and kept me smiling during the entire date. He said he does taekwondo so he can fights others if ever needed. He has a good heart who can get serious if he needs to be.
Katie Catherine,Smoking hot. Like super hot. But also kinda weird. She sounded like she was talking in Parseltongue so maybe she likes Harry Potter or other fictional stuff. Does not like doing schoolwork and would rather go exploring.
Aria Sahita,Very attentitive and optimistic. She takes academics very seriously and is part of the Scholars program so she travel a lot. She's been to over 20 countries so she's super cultural and informative. 10/10 date!
Johnny Bears,He's a gamer who also likes to hike so he balances out hobbies. He's a vegetarian and also Muslim which he got from his family. He said that he really loves his family and friends and he always prioritizes them.
Roberto Lam,"Went on a date with Roberto in Montreal while we were both at McGill. I thought it was going to be really nice; we started out at a nice bar that I hadn't seen before, and I was really enjoying his sense of humor. However, he suggested that we go to another bar called Tokyo, which ended up being the grimiest, slimiest bar I've ever seen. Awful!"
Emilie Bowden,"Emilie and I went for a run as our first date which was really nice. We talked about each other's hobbies, and I got to see her roommate's dog Maximilian. Very pleasant afternoon, really down-to-earth girl."
Frank Hicks,"Frank took me rock climbing for our first date. He was really supportive, and just enjoyed sharing his passions with me. I got the feeling that he's a very genuine, passionate guy who likes spending time outdoors. Fantastic date!"
Amelia Levy,Amelia and I went on a date at a local coffee shop and talked about each other's interests. Amelia's a swim coach and a nurse; she loves helping people. I really liked how we spent time talking about each other's backgrounds and how that led to our personalities today. 
Brandon Donald,"Brandon is a very laid back guy. He let me talk almost the whole time. At first I thought he just didn't care about me, but he asked a couple questions that made it really clear that he was listening to me. Hopefully we get to see each other again!"
Sami Murphy,"Sami might be a nice girl, but I didnt' see it. She kept telling me about how she hated her roommates, and that she was so much better than them. Very self-absorbed, it was a really awful two hours. Don't go on a date with this girl unless you have to."
Carson Needham,"Carson appeared to be incredibly smart, a total engineering nerd. Then he got drunk, and we raged through the city like a pair of banshees. Just a fantastic mix of smart and rockstar. We had a fantastic time, and I would love to see him again."
Kara Adams,"I had an OK time with Kara. She's very pretty, but didn't really have a whole lot to talk about. It felt like she was too worried about how everyone else would perceive her. Maybe more self-confidence would help, but for now, I don't think I'll be seeing her again."
Emmett Dupont,"Emmett was an absolute rockstart to hang out with. We went on one nice date, then he suggested we tailgate together and I got to witness the animal inside. At one point he walked up and cracked an egg on my head then ate it raw. What a manly man."
Matilda Colon,"Matilda is a nice girl with an incredibly dark sense of humor. At first, I was a little scared, but then I relaxed and we had a really nice time together. I would for sure go on another date with Matilda, given the opportunity."
Jodi Chambers,"She is really nice overall. We went fishing and she was surprisingly skillful. She has a pet bird that stays on her sholder and feed it some of the worms that were supposed to be bait. She also ate some of the worms herself, which was wierd. But I had fun"
Fintan Marquez,"This guy is awesome. From the moment I saw his manicured mustache, I knew that we were going to have a funky and wild time. We went to a disco ball and got totally wasted before 8:00pm. Then he talked about the dark secrets he was hiding from his friends for a few hours. It was a really fascinating experience. I wouldn't want to do it again, though."
Elsie Booth,"Soooo boring. She just kept talking and gossiping the whole time. I don't even know who Sami Murphy is, why do you keep talking about her? In the end, I learned more about the people she hated then her. At least the italian food we ate was good."
Constance Bishop,"She has long black bangs, tatoos, and lots of piercings. She was really goth and kept talking about how depressing life is. Her house was creepy, with a lot of detailed artistic paintings. My life is also depressing, so we got along well."
Fahim Shepard,"Very rustic, the prototypical kind of person who grew up on a farm. Doesn't use a lot of technology (he never brought out his phone!) and has a big beard. He could be a match for someone else."
Alessia Bryant,"She brought a friend along for the date, which I was not expecting at all. So the 3 of us were just at mcdonalds eating hamburgers and it was not what I expected. But in the end we went to her house and played some board games, it was fun."
Aleksandra Stuart,"I'm so impressed by this girl, she's the number 3 best call of duty player in the world. We played and I got destroyed. She was really sociable and fun to talk to, but then it was all serious mode when playing games. A work hard, play hard kind of personality"
Anisha Galvan,"Smelly and ugly, I was depressed the first second I met her, counting down the minutes to awkardly say goodbye. But then, turns out she's also really good at chemistry. I love chemistry and we hit it off amazingly. She's so smart I'd do it again, even if she stunk twice as bad"
Humphrey Bostock,"I can't get over how grumpy this guy is. He just frowned at me the whole time. I tried to make fun conversation and he told me the world was going to end and shamed me for making light of the situation. But he has a lot of money, so I want to marry him."
